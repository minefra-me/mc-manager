# MC Manager

We use this tool to manage our servers. It may come in pretty handy if your server setup is similar to ours.

## Config files

A config file is a text file ending with `.mmcfg` and contains content like this:

```
server:yourservername
server1#Stuff that should be displayed when managing it like a name or something
server2#Server 2
blah#blahblah
```
